This repository contains most of my work on data analysis and building data pipelines using different languages, tools and frameworks.

# SQL files:
SQL file 1 contains script to load the required database, SQL files 2 to 4 contain procedures to manipulate and modify the loaded database.

# Java (Hadoop) files:
WordLength.java contains a data pipeline using the Hadoop framework to count the length of words and return the result, works with the WordLength.jar file.

# PySpark_pipeline:
Contains code that creates pipelines that clean, analyse, manipulate data and visualize the results using the pyspark framework.

# Scikit_pipeline:
Contians code that creates pipelines that clean and manipulate data before applying an ML model and analysing the results, all of which is done using the sklearn framework.
